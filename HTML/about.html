    <p> Kirchhoffâ€™s of current law:

        It states that in any network of the conductors, the algebraic sum of currents meeting at a point is zero. In
        the other hand it is simply means that the total current leaving a junction is equal to the total current
        entering that junction</p>

    <p>Air pollution is a major environmental problem with many sources that can have severe harmful effects on human
        health, livelihood, and biodiversity. Air pollution sources can be natural, such as volcanic eruptions and
        wildfires, but the majority of air pollution comes from human activities, such as transportation, energy
        production, and industrial processes. <br> <br> In the context of Nepal, air pollution is a significant issue,
        particularly in urban areas like the Pokhara Valley. The main contributors to air pollution in Nepal is the
        increasing number of vehicles, poor waste management system, and use of fuel wood and biomass for heating and
        cooking. <br> <br> Air pollution can have several adverse effects on human health, including respiratory and
        cardiovascular diseases, and can impact wildlife and ecosystems such as reduced crop yields and biodiversity.
        <br> <br> Individuals can play an active role in controlling air pollution through various measures like using
        public transportation, reducing energy consumption, and proper waste management. <br> <br> With the advancement
        of technology, air pollution sensors and research are useful in measuring and monitoring air quality. The Air
        Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to communicate the level of air pollution, indicating how harmful it is to
        breathe polluted air. <br> <br> Air pollution control and adaptation techniques can include, for example,
        reducing emissions through the implementation of better transportation systems, the use of cleaner fuels, and
        the promotion of environmentally friendly energy sources. Additionally, individuals can increase their
        resilience to air pollution by building stronger immune systems and reducing exposure to pollutants through
        protective measures.</p>
